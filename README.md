### stupid snake game written in C with Raylib
- hardcoded window width, heigt
- hardcoded 60 FPS
- only arrow keys for controlling funny snake
- no include guards
- horrible Makefile

#### requirements:
- gcc / or any C compiler (change in Makefile)

- make

- raylib -> default path is "./raylib-5.5_linux_amd64/"
if your path is different, you need to change the path in Makefile and lib.h
you can do it!

#### build:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FailC/snake.git
cd snake
make
```
#### run:
```bash
./main
```
